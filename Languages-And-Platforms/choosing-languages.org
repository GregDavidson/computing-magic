* Choosing Computer Languages

** Some Criteria for Choosing Languages

Let's use *hack* in the /MIT/ sense, of an ability to bend something to your
will through informed programming. See
- [[http://www.catb.org/esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html][Jargon: Hacker]]
- [[https://web.archive.org/web/20210812150702/https://hack.org/faq-hacker.html][FAQ: Hacker]]

There at least two important reasons to learn a computer language
- Pragmatic :: It's useful for /hacking/ on important things
- Pedagogical :: Learning it and using it will make you a better /hacker/

In this era of hundreds of useful and interesting languages, we must be even
more discriminating. The languages truly worth our time must be
- Useful :: practically /and/ pedagogically
- Elegant :: minimum complexity and cognitive burden for maximum utility

We can immediately dismiss the [[http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html][blub languages]] because they lack power and don't
teach us much; indeed, [[https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/ewd498.html][they can even harm us]] or [[https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/03/its-not-what-programming-languages-do.htmlquality][lead us astray]]! These essays
are old and I'll avoid the mistake of listing today's /blub/ or harmful
languages - they might be languages you currently like! You'll be able to form
your own opinions after gaining experience with some unquestionably excellent
languages.

I generally disregard programmers' opinions about a programming language unless
- they have significant experience using it
      - the way it was designed to be used
      - in ways unanticipated by its designers
- they have significant experience with alternative languages
      - both in the same family and in different families
Opinions of such experienced experts are well worth listening to!

** Some Especially Great Languages

For the more complete list and explanation, see /Families Of Great Languages/ below.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems][Knowledge-Based]] Programming
      - this paradigm is especially good for creating /Knowledge-Based Expert Systems/
      - good example languages are [[https://flora.sourceforge.net][Flora-2]] and its successor [[https://github.com/ErgoAI][ErgoAI]]

** Families Of Great Languages

Computer Languages belong to Computer Language Families and are usually
organized around [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm][Programming Paradigms]]. Unless there's a pragmatic reason, you
don't need to waste time learning languages which will teach you nothing new.
With experience, you can pick up a language in a familiar family and be
productive in a few hours and masterful in a few days - I stopped counting
languages after I'd used 60 languages for significant projects.


*** [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/on-lisp#readme][Lisps]]

The Lisp family contains some of the most flexible general purpose high-level
languages. See [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/on-lisp#readme][On Lisp]] for more depth. Lisps in the Scheme family are among the
most elegant, where elegance refers to a combination of power and simplicity.

Lisp systems are Multi-Paradigm with good support for
- Functional Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Imperative Programming

Pros:
- Programmer Freedom to Mix&Match Styles and Paradigms
- Lisp Programs are also Lisp Data
- Good for Meta-Programming and Syntactic Macros
Cons:
- Mixing&Matching can make programs hard to understand!

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)][Scheme invented Lisp Killer Features]]
      - All Scheme Procedures are Lambda Procedures
      - End-Calls aka Tail-Calls are Compiled Away
      - Delimited Continuations provide Ultimate Control!
      - The Numeric Tower
- Languages based on or evolved from Scheme
      - [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket - builds a rich ecosystem around Scheme]]
      - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile][Guile - Scheme with Pragmatic Extensions]]
- Clojure aims for minimalism and pulls it off!
      - [[https://clojure.org][Clojure compiles to the JVM]]
      - [[https://clojurescript.org][ClojureScript compiles to JavaScript]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common Lisp is the most featureful Lisp]]
- [[Emacs/elisp-vs-scheme.org][Emacs Lisp is the source of Emacs power]]

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Logic_programming_languages][Logic]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_logic_programming][and]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming][Constraint]] Programming

Logic and Constraint programming is the highest-level of Declarative
Programming, i.e. programming where you say what is true in your domain and what
you want (this is called the specification of your problem) and the computer
figures out an effective procedure to compute what you want. Your specification
is typically much smaller than a traditional program and easier to verify. If
your specification is correct, the automatically generated program can only give
correct answers. This is powerful Computing Magic!

- There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Logic_programming_languages][many Logic-Programming Languages]]
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWI-Prolog][SWI-Prolog]] - very popular
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciao_(programming_language)][Ciao Prolog]] - also great for constraint logic programming
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSB][XSB Prolog]] - the language underlying the [[https://github.com/ErgoAI][ErgoAI Platform]]

*** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems][Knowledge-Based]] Programming

In Knowledge-Based Logic Programming you represent the knowledge of a rich
domain with definite and probabilistic rules. The Knowledge Engine uses
automated reasoning to answer your questions and solve your problems. Many
Knowledge-Based Systems have demonstrated human and greater than human
performance in diverse areas, including
- Diagnosis and Treatment of specific Diseases
- Configuration of complex systems
- Interpretation of scientific data
- Symbolic mathematics
- Logistics, Accounting, Tax Preparation
- and on and on

The wide success of Knowledge-Based Systems in the 1980s led to a great deal of
hype along with an explosion of business ventures in this area. Lack of
expertise and poor management produced a flood of poor-quality products which
collapsed confidence in the technology. This was one of the factors in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter][AI
Winter]]. Many experts are concerned that the current hype for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning][Machine Learning]]
may lead to another collapse. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_intelligent_system][Hybrid AI Systems]] combine the technology of
Knowledge-Based Systems with Machine Learning to overcome the limitations of the
limitations of each individual technology.

Knowledge-Based Programming is a natural extension of Constraint Logic
Programming

Many frameworks have been created for Knowledge-Based Programming
- [[https://github.com/ErgoAI][ErgoAI Platform]]

*** Systems Programming Languages

Paradigms
- Imperative Programming
- Limited Functional Programming - especially with Rust

Systems Programming is the art of writing programs which directly control
hardware devices, called device drivers and programs which directly control
the low-level systems abstractions provided by operating system kernels, e.g.
- Filesystems
- File and Network Streams
- Packet Switching
- Low-level Graphics and Audio
- etc.

- [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/C-By-Example#readme][C]] is the lowest-level popular language
      - C is great for learning how computers work
- [[https://www.rust-lang.org][Rust]] is a remarkably flexible and elegant systems programming language
      - higher-level than C
      - simpler and more reliable than C++
      - advanced features for control of resources
      - great for parallelism, utilizing multiple CPUs and GPUs

*** Relational Programming

All data in primary memory (RAM) is volatile and is erased when a program
terminates, whether that was planned, caused by a crash or by a power loss.
Secondary memory (SSDs, HDDs) will persist without power but are 1000 to
1,000,000 times slower than primary memory. Database systems are the most
powerful and flexible ways of managing persistent storage. Most Database Systems
follow the Relational Model and use the standard query language SQL.

- [[SQL/SQL-README.org][SQL]]

*** Some Extraordinary Languages

Paradigms
- These languages have their own special Paradigm
      - In some ways like Functional Programming
      - with extraordinary power yet less abstraction

**** Array-Oriented Languages

The Iverson family of Languages use elegant compact notations allowing for
remarkably short and powerful programs. These languages are very powerful and
practical for many kinds of programming. They are especially good for building
intuitions which open the power of multidimensional arrays which can then be
exploited in any language.

- APL is famous for its use of special characters
      - Try [[https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN][BQN for a modern alternative]]
- [[https://www.jsoftware.com][J]] uses regular characters in a very compact notation

**** Smalltalks

The Smalltalk languages are a very pure expression of the ideal of dynamic
Object Oriented Languages. They are especially good for art and multi-media
simulations. They will teach you how to think in the Object Oriented paradigm
which you can then use in other languages.

Paradigms
- Pure Object-Oriented with Inheritance

- [[https://squeak.org][Squeak Smalltalk]] is the most popular
- [[ttps://pharo.org][Pharo Smalltalk]] is an elegant and fast-moving alternative

**** Typed Functional Languages

[[https://www.haskell.org][Haskell]] is the poster-child for developing programs by first expressing
the types and relationships in the program.  Haskell will teach you powerful
ways of thinking about programming and how to create programs that are much
more reliable than usual.

*** Web and XML Languages

- JavaScript
      - Famously powerful, famously flawed!
- TypeScript adds Haskell-like typing to JavaScript
      - Fixes much of JavaScript's weaknesses
- [[https://clojurescript.org][ClojureScript]]
      - Clojure Lisp compiled to JavaScript
      - Use ClojureScript if you use Clojure on your server

*** Document Languages

These languages structure and present your information. They also provide hooks
for programming language to manipulate your documents in creative ways.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5][HTML5]]
      - [[https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/][Features]] and [[https://www.w3.org/TR/][Standards]]
      - CSS
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML][XML]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML][XHTML]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT][XSLT]]
- [[https://orgmode.org][OrgMode]] - an Emacs /Killer-App/ for creating /Active Documents/
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX][ΤΕΧ]] - a Turning-Complete markup language for printed documents
- [[https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/what-is-opendocument/][Open Document]] - the basis for [[https://www.libreoffice.org][LibreOffice]] and [[https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/opendocument/][More]]
- [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble][Scribble: A Racket-based Documentation Language]]

*** Shells and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language][Domain Specific Languages]]

Shells allow casual users and experts to create scripts (simple programs) to
automate tasks and control applications.

Domain Specific Languages, DSLs (especially those coming out of the Software
Tools movement associated with Unix) are especially powerful for specialized
tasks, especially where the data is in the form of text in files and streams.

Shells
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell][sh: Bourne Shell]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash][Bash]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell#External_links][zsh]]

Text-Oriented DSLs
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression][Regular Expressions]]
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep][grep: Global Regular Expression Print]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_(text_editor)][ed scriptable scripting editor]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed][sed scriptable stream editor]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK][awk powerful scriptable text processor]]

Automated development tools are like Shells for Shells
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)][make: automate file processing]]

** Comparing Languages and Paradigms

Some good videos
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4][Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm? – Richard Feldman]]

The [[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Languages][Rosetta Code]] site has brief explanations and examples of over 900
programming languages. Choice of language can have a big impact on ease of
solving particular problems.

Choice of language can also have a big impact on [[https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html][how fast your programs run]] and
other performance criteria.

It's hard to compare languages objectively. Many programs on Rosetta Code or
Competitive Programming Sites are not written the way one would usually program
in those languages. You have to be able to think in a language before you
understand it properly. This takes time but can be very rewarding!

** Programming Productivity

Support the various powerful Programming Paradigms only accounts for some
aspects of Programming Productivity.

This section may be the most important but it's too dry - can you help?

*** Aspects of programming Productivity

Expressivity
- How easily can you express your ideas?
      - After you've learned a language well!
      - And how hard was that?
- Can the code evolve as your ideas evolve?
      - See maintainability below!

Reliability
- Can you easily avoid
      - Security Issues
            - Data Leeks, Privilege Escalation,
            - Malware intrusion, etc.
      - Unexpected and undesirable behavior
            - Race Conditions
            - Allocation Issues
                  - Use after Free
                  - Memory Leaks
- Can you /Prove/ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correctness_(computer_science)][your program will be well-behaved]]?

Maintainability
- How easily can you
      - add features
            - with minimum added complexity
      - generalize features
            - adding capability while reducing complexity
            - gracefully accommodating increased abstraction
      - refactor complex code
            - to make it less clumsy
            - to prepare for improvements
      - debug undesired behavior
            - and properly fix rather than merely patch such?

Performance
- Are your great ideas limited by your language's performance?

Software Design Patterns
- Can you easily use well-known solutions to common problems?

Libraries, Frameworks, Tools
- Can you leverage existing well-designed and well-written code?
      - What is available for your language?
      - Can you easily find what would help you?
      - How easy is it to use and incorporate these things?
- Are the libraries and frameworks readable in your language?
      - Or do you need to learn another, lower level language?
            - Python libraries tend to be written in C!
      - If they're written in the same language you know
            - Are they understandable given normal skill in your language?
            - Can you easily extend them, debug them, learn from them?
- Can you package your ideas into a reusable form?
      - I.e. write your own libraries and frameworks?
