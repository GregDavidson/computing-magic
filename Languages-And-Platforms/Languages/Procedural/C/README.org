* The C Programming Language

** TL;dr

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C][ANSI C]] programming language of 1989 is
- simple
- easy to learn and to use for small simple programming projects
- useful for a beginning understanding how machines run programs

Every serious programmer should learn C in order to learn
- procedural programming
- how computers run programs

C should be avoided for any new large or complex projects.

A good start for learning ANSI C is

** The C Paradigm

The C Programming Language is designed for
- low-level procedural programming
      - directly manipulating each byte or word
- low-level operating-system components
- small simple applications
 
The C Programming Language was originally
- very simple
- easy to compile to most machine architectures
- with predictable performance


** The C Paradigm

The C Programming Language belongs to an era
- the late 1960s and early 1970s
when computers were
- much simpler than today's computers
- with much less performance

C was the main language of the Unix Operating System
- starting with the 4th Edition of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Unix][Research Unix]] in 1973
- the Unix Kernel and most Unix Libraries and Utilities were written in C

The success of C and Unix influenced many other Operating Systems to choose C as
their main implementation language including
- the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_BSD_operating_systems][BSD]] family's kernels, libraries and utilities
      - The BSDs are strongly based on the Unix architecture
- the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)][Mach Microkernel]]
- Apple's Operating Systems -- based on Mach and BSD
- The Linux Kernel along with most GNU Libraries and Utilities
      - Gnu/Linux is strongly based on the Unix architecture

When the author of C, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie][Dennis Ritchie]] was asked
- What's the best way of writing larger programs in C?
he famously replied
- Don't!

C does not have the
