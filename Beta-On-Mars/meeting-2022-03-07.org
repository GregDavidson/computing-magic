* Computing Magic Meeting, Mars, Monday, 7 March 2022

Today we talked about Computing Magic Fundamentals

Complexity is the Enemy of Magic

Powerful Unifying Ideas

Allowing for a diversity of interests in those following the course

It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.
-- Alan Perlis
#+END_QUOTE
Sets and Sequences which have minimal visible structure
- In Traditional Lisps this generally means using Lists as much as possible.
- In Modern Lisps this means using a generic sequence abstraction
- In SQL this means writing simple normalized code

Keeping things simple with
- Functional Programming
- Relational Programming

Having things magical with
- Compositionality 
- Metaprogrammability
- Refactoring rather than editing syntax

- Smart and elegant development tools which assist in developing
      - Code from Type
      - Type from Code
      - Type, Code, Proofs (Invariants) and Tests together
- And also with
      - hiding unnecessary complexity
      - individual developer flexibility
            - Language and brevity control
            - Underlying functional syntax plus lightweight intuitive sugar
      - Easy refactoring of early-binding constructs
