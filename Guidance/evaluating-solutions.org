* Evaluating Solutions to Computing Challenges

A computing challenge aka "problem" inspires you to come up with a solution. How
can you evaluate its quality?

How it enriched YOU
- Did you have fun coming up with your solution?
- Did you learn things?
  - Are you now more capable?
  - Are you inspired to explore more?
- What other possibilities now show up?

Practical issues?
- How does your solution's resource requirements compare to other solutions?
  - Time & Space complexity
  - Human Interface resources, if any
  - Others, e.g. network, graphics, co-processors, ...

How easy is it to use as 1 or more black boxes?
- Usage as a library or component or module?
  - Composability is a big deal!
- Non-intrusive Extensibility, customizability

Beauty of the solution
- Clarity
- In what langugaes and/or notations?

Evolvability
- Where can you go from your solution?
  - in which design spaces?
  - small or large jumps?
- What's possible by combining your solution with other ideas?
