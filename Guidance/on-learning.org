* Guidance on Self-Directed Learning

** You Are In Charge!

Please ignore, at least for now, anything written here which you don't currently
find helpful!

You get to choose
- What you intend to learn or explore
- How you're going to go about it

Guidance is gold
- when you're ready for it
- when you actively explore it

** General Guidance

- There's a way that you can learn /anything/.
- A good Learning Path will rapidly Accumulate Knowledge.
      - Knowledge will become Understanding
      - Understanding will become Mastery
- Understanding will Broaden and Deepen
      - Different areas will get connected

You don't need to be strongly goal driven
- While loosely held goals are sometimes helpful
- you need to explore an area to discover what's available

You'll know when Learning is present
- It's exciting, fun, exhilarating
- Everything gets more richer and more interesting
- Learning is /Intrinsically Rewarding/

When it's not like this
- Stop!
- Get advice from experienced Learners!
- Shift to a more exploratory approach!

Trying to force learning can cause damage!
- damage is often reparable, but not quickly or easily
- many of us have damage from, e.g. poor schooling
- repairing damaged learning can be an ongoing practice

** About Advice

Solicit and listen to advice from other learners.
- Try to understand how their methods work for them
- If any pieces of their advice seems right for you, try those pieces
      - Modify them as you will
      - Discard them when they're not useful
- If or when any of their advice doesn't seem right for you
      - Can you translate their method into something that might work for you?
      - Does their advice provoke you to see something else you want to try?
- Thank them for sharing their advice!

Prefer input from other learners rather than experts
- Especially those a little bit ahead of you
You want to build your own intuition and understanding
- Avoid premature tips, formulas, procedures, answers
- Avoid premature abstraction

Use experts sparingly to
- show you more possibilities, not answers
- help you find resources
- broaden what you've learned

** Use Open Culture Materials and Open Source Tools

Strongly prefer learning materials which are
- Freely redistributable
- In open, editable formats

Strongly prefer software which is
- Open Source, especially Free/Libre

Strongly prefer Hardware which is
- Freely Inspectable -- no inaccessible components
- Modifiable
- Replicable, e.g. via 3D Printers or Fab Labs

** How To Use Tutorials

Good Tutorials are great to give you a path to elaborate

A good tutorial is worth going through more than once.

One time, maybe the first time?
- go through the tutorial as intended
- see if you can learn what they intended you to learn

At least one time:
- learn more about any commands or tools they used
- follow the advice below on Reference Manuals
- explore your own variations

** How To Use Documentation

Complex systems often come with a variety of documentation
- Tutorials
- Guides
- Cookbooks and HOWTOs
- Reference Manuals
- In-Depth Articles, Books, etc.

They each serve different purposes
- You can also get lost in them, dissipating your energy!
- You can make each kind of documentation serve you!

Good Tutorials can help you get started and focus your initial learning
- See the full section on Tutorials above
- As you get oriented your own projects will give you your focus

** Making Reference Manuals Serve You

Strategy
- Learn something you need
- Learn just one extra thing

Details
- Go into a Reference Manual with a specific need or purpose in mind
- Learn something which will help you move forward in your purpose
- And learn just one extra thing
      - Something you find particularly interesting
      - Or which you can clearly see will be helpful in the future
      - Sometimes something you wish you'd known earlier!
- Ignore all of the other interesting things there
      - You'll be back!
- Over time, the "learn just one extra thing" will build up
      - You'll discover you're an expert!

** Using Books and other In-Depth Expositions

The best books are
- Short!
      - You could easily read them more than once
      - A good book gives you /core understanding/
- Accessible
      - Minimum jargon
      - Necessary jargon and pre-requisites clearly explained

** Immersive Learning Materials

- Immersive materials are designed to be actively explored.
- Feedback illuminates everything you do
- Trying alternatives is encouraged

** Take Notes and Refine Your Notes

Use a structured system such as OrgMode.

Where applicable record your knowledge as
- Scripts
- Makefiles
- Literate Programs
