* Learning More & Better Racket

** What is Racket and Why is Racket Special?

In Computing we call something /elegant/ when it achieves great power with
minimal complexity.

Racket is one of the most /elegant/ modern programming languages and
environments.

- Racket started out as a fleshed-out variant of Scheme
      - Scheme was primarily a teaching language
      - Racket added features needed for practical programming
- Racket provides extensive tools and libraries
- Racket provides a system for creating new languages
      - Customized to a specific domain
      - With special syntax and semantics
      - Use one or more Racket Languages to solve complex problems
- Racket is all /Open Source Free Software!/

** Paths to Learning (More) Racket?

Racket is best learned by Exploring, that is to say
1. Read a bit about it, e.g. from a Tutorial or other Guidebook
2. Replicate the examples or similar examples
3. Experiment a bit beyond the examples
4. Look up a few things in the Reference Manual
5. Repeat with step 1!

** A Fast Path for Learning Racket

Here's a good Learning Path
1. Work through the module [[file:~/Gits/Computing-Magic/Modules/Module-1][Acquiring A Lisp]]
2. Explore the [[file:Tutorial-1-Pictures/after-quick.rkt][after-quick.rkt]] program
3. Assimilate this [[https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/racket][Racket Overview Tutorial]]
4. Read and Explore [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/on-lisp/blob/main/lisp-simplicity.org][Lisp Simplicity]]
5. Possibly explore more materials in the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/on-lisp#readme][On Lisp]] repository
6. Work through [[http://www.htdp.org/][How to Design Programs]]
7. Work through the other [[https://docs.racket-lang.org][Racket Tutorials]]
       - especially [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/more/index.html][More: Systems Programming with Racket]]
8. Explore other [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/index.html][Racket Resources]]
9. Pull ideas from [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html][The Racket Guide]]


** An alternative Path via Creating Games in Racket

Designing and creating computer games is one of the best all-around paths to learning
diverse computing skills.  We have a whole module which takes this path:

** More Great Resources for Learning Racket

Master Racket (and Scheme) Macros!
- I recommend Greg Hendershott's /excellent/ tutorial [[https://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros][Fear of Macros]]!
- Scheme-Family macros are /much more powerful/ than macros in other Lisps!

[[https://dev.to/goober99/learn-racket-by-example-gui-programming-3epm][Learn Racket with Examples of Graphical User Interfaces]]
- Learn to create programs with beautiful Graphical User Interfaces!

Learn [[https://web.mit.edu/racket_v612/amd64_ubuntu1404/racket/doc/ts-guide/][Typed Racket]]!
- Add compile-time checked types to some of your other programs
- Good typing will prevent many kinds of bugs in your programs
- The Types also deepen your understanding of your programs

[[https://github.com/zyrolasting/racket-koans/tree/master#readme][Racket Koans: Make these programs pass their Unit Tests!]]
- Hone your Racket understanding through these programming puzzles!
- Unit Tests can automate program testing

Ideally you'll use Typed/Racket plus Unit Tests to
- Improve the design of your programs
- Eliminate nearly all bugs

Typed/Racket Macros can examine types at compile time allowing for advanced
metaprogramming - short simple programs which automatically expand into custom
code!
