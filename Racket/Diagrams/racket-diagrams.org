* Racket Diagrams

The original idea of this package is to create a nice set of Racket functions
for rendering Racket data structures as Racket =pict= objects to accompany
explanations of such data structures. The intention of the diagrams is to
provide insight as to the /physical layout/ of such data structures in memory.

The original design and implementation uses recursive traversal of said data
structures along with lots of rendering options. The work is delegated to
simpler functions which can be reused for different purposes.

This work has inspired me to begin designing a constraint-oriented diagramming
package. See [[file:constrained-picts.org][constrained-picts.org]] for more on that!
