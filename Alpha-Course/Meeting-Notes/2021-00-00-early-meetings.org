* Computing Magic, Early Meetings and Getting Started

Notes from the early and formational [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic#readme][Computing Magic Project]] Meetings

** How we got here

The current [[file:../cm-curriculum.org][Computing Magic Curriculum]] emerged after a number of presentations
and discussions of aspects of [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic#readme][Computing Magic]] with the wonderful members of the
[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSUTfoOXDAfoH-OF_7N7kEzlp5-F4nf0JP3BzgppDY0][Limitless Fellowship]] in 2021 and earlier.

The early presentations were too complex, but some people wanted to find a way
to learn Computing Magic. After some false starts, we settled on the strategy of
leveraging the [[https://racket-lang.org/][Racket Language]] starting with its excellent [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/][Quick]] tutorial. The
tutorial is mostly self-guiding and is easy to enrich with
- variations such as [[file:../../Racket/Tutorial-1-Pictures/after-quick.rkt][after-quick.rkt]]
- how lambda is hiding under [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/on-lisp/blob/main/lambda-sugar.rkt][lambda-sugar.rkt]]
- and so on

** Getting Started

If you want to plunge into the [[file:../cm-curriculum.org][Computing Magic Curriculum]], start by doing the
[[https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/][Quick]] tutorial as an /exploration:/
- Download DrRacket for your computer
- Run DrRacket side-by-side with a browser open on the tutorial
- Try variations on each example before going on to the next example
- Write down questions
- *Discuss things with other folks who started the Curriculum earlier*
  - and anyone who is at the same level too!

You can look up any Racket procedure in the Reference Manual by putting the
cursor on the procedure name in DrRacket and hitting F1.

Hints when reading Reference Manuals:
- Try to learn /at most/ two things each time you explore the manuals
At this initial stage:
- Don't worry about the formal language - skim over it!
- Seriously limit exploration of the links to related topics!

After you've finished Section 8 on Lists in the Quick tutorial, read
- [[file:../after-quick.rkt][after-quick.rkt]]
- [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/on-lisp/blob/main/lambda-sugar.rkt][lambda-sugar.rkt]]

If you're ambitious, You might want to lightly explore
- [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html][The Racket Guide]]
- [[https://htdp.org/2021-5-4/Book/index.html][How to Design Programs]]

Now you are ready to continue by 
1. Continuing on with the elements of the [[file:../cm-curriculum.org][Computing Magic Curriculum]]
2. Reading the notes of the meetings you've missed
3. Discussing it all with others
4. Attending the new meetings
 
Also, if the description of the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSUTfoOXDAfoH-OF_7N7kEzlp5-F4nf0JP3BzgppDY0][Limitless Fellowship]] speaks to you,
