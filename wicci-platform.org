#+title: The Wicci As A Platform
* Evaluating The Wicci as a Platform- DRAFT
** Status, Purpose, Audience and Background
*** Status of this Document

This document is a /DRAFT/. Please see the section /Help Improve This Document/
at the bottom.

*** Purpose, Who We Are, What We're Up To

The purpose of this document is to (1) evaluate the potential and (2) guide the
development of [[https://gregdavidson.github.io/wicci-core-S0_lib/][The Wicci System]] as a General-Purpose Platform for Empowering the
Development of computer systems for Intelligent Content Management and Creative
Collaboration.

We are software designers and developers creating innovative computer-based
systems which we hope will be of great benefit to humanity. We develop and
release our software systems using Computing Platforms - collections of
languages, tools, frameworks and libraries intended to increase the
productivity, quality and efficiency of computer-based projects. We have used
many Computing Platforms in our prior projects and have found most of them
wanting. The design of most contemporary Computing Platforms are not a good
match for many of the approaches we find most valuable, inhibiting our
productivity as well as the success and quality of our work.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra][Edsger Dijkstra]] said that to solve a challenging problem with a computer, we
should /not/ imagine solving it with the kinds of computers that already exist.
Instead, we should (1) Imagine a machine [platform] that would be a good fit for
solving our problem, (2) solve our problem using that machine, and then (3)
implement that machine. In practice there is iteration between steps (1) and
(2) - and step (3) invokes Dijkstra's approach recursively!

In addition to doing a good job of supporting a many projects which we think are
important for humanity, our desired platform should provide good support for
its own continued development and have  excellent support for collaborative
development processes.

The evolution of the design of The Wicci System has been driven by both Top-Down
and Bottom-Up considerations. The original Top-Down driver was creating a better
kind of Wiki system - /Wicci/ was intended to be a pun on /Wiki/. See /Example
Facilities and Applications/ below for more on that and other Top-Down drivers.
The Bottom-Up drivers began with mechanisms for mapping hierarchical data
structures (such as those used for storing Documents) in a Relational Database
without mutation or with only monotonic mutation. See /What Makes The Wicci
System Special/ below for more about our Bottom-Up drivers.

Although the development of the original Wicci System is not complete, it is now
clear that The Wicci System has potential to be an excellent and empowering
platform for many kinds of applications and systems, including many which
address important human needs.

We are in the process of making The Wicci System sufficient to (1) fulfill its
original goals, (2) be a good platform to support its own further development
and (3) evolve towards becoming a great platform for many other projects. We
intend this document to clarify our criteria so as to (1) guide us in our work
and (2) communicate our goals to others such as yourself, such that they and you
(a) might advise us and (b) possibly join our project.

*** Who we think /you/ are

This document is written for you, dear reader! We're assuming that you're
someone with a role in using computers creatively to build interesting and
powerful systems which matter to you and which may make a difference to many
others.

Once The Wicci System is a going concern, it will enable participation by people
of any level of technical or non-technical background.

In this early phase, if you do not have a background in the technical aspects of
this project you can still help us (1) refine our goals, (2) communicate our
goals and (3) find suitable others to participate.

If you have an interest in the technologies underlying The Wicci Project we
invite you to learn more about those details and discover if you'd like to
participate as a development partner!

** Providing Access to Information

The primary scope of The Wicci System is managing and providing access to
Human-Scale Information, i.e. the information we human beings deal with in our
daily lives. This includes Private Personal Information and Information which we
Share with members of Our Projects and Our Communities.

*** Examples of Human-Scale information

Human-Scale information is wildly open-ended and includes:

Messages and Posts
- EMail, Voice and Text Messages
- Social Media and Blog Posts
 
Office Documents
- Articles, Books
- Spreadsheets
- Documents with Figures including
  - SVG Diagrams
  - Dynamic Tables

Collections of
- Bookmarks, Contacts
- Quotes, Pictures
- Multimedia Recordings

Scheduling Information
- Events, Reminders
- Invitations, Requests, Promises

Creative Documents
- Source Code of a Software System
  - including of The Wicci System itself!
- Media Files of a Movie or art project
- Diverse materials for a Computer Game
- etcetera!

Meta-Data for all of the above
- Semantic Tags
- Hierarchical Folders
- Semantic Stable Hyperlinks

*** What is (mostly) out of scope?

The Wicci System is based on the PostgreSQL Object-Relational Database System
using portable techniques and extensions to increase its flexibility and
representational power. Although PostgreSQL is an efficient and extensible RDBMS,
The Wicci System is not intended to extend PostgreSQL's normal storage and
computational envelope.

The Wicci System provides no features for
- Big Data, i.e. any data where
  - the storage requirements would stress an RDBMS
  - the computational operations don't align with Relational Operations
- Streaming Data
- Computation-limited Operations
  - e.g. requiring GPUs and other special facilities

Filesystems and Database Systems have always been "abused" to hold data which is
not a great fit for them. We expect The Wicci System to be stretched in this way
and we require The Wicci System to be resilient - integrity must always be
maintained and performance should suffer no more than necessary in a system
built on a Relational Database Management System.

While The Wicci System is not intended to compete with systems designed to store
and process /Raw Data/, Data Processing often yields structured information of a
form which might benefit from storage in The Wicci System.

The Wicci System should not be incompatible with extensions from other projects


** Example Applications

The Kinds of Information above begin to suggest what kind of facilities and
applications it might be natural to build using the Wicci as a Platform. Here
are a few examples chosen to illuminate the extent of that possible design
space.

*** Scheduling an Event

You create an Event (which internally creates a Global Event Object) and you
Share it with your designated Recipients Chris, Dana and all the members of your
Outing Group who live within 100 kilometers. As the Owner-Host, you can delegate
all or some privileges of managing the Event to co-hosts.

You (and your delegates) control changes and policies for the Global Event Object.
Recipients can extend the Event Object with additional information which only
/they/ control. Such extended information is (by default) only visible to
that Recipient although the Recipient could selectively or globally Share
any such extended information.

The first use of the Event might be to determine who's interested, the best time
to meet, and other preliminaries with the initial interested Recipients. The
Event Status evolves and a sharing policy is established allowing interested
Recipients to use the Event Object in enrollment conversations, perhaps widening
the Recipient pool even though some Recipients may Withdraw from the Event.

Discussions and artifacts related to the Event before, during and after it takes
place are linked to the Event Object. The Event Object can be Tagged and also
used as a Tag, e.g. in my Contact Object for Robin who I met at that event. Links
are semantic, so a link to another Event Object in a series is distinguishable
from a link between the Event and a Participant, etc.

Note that Recipient-Controlled Extended Information can be implemented with the
Semantic Tag mechanism.

*** Collaborative Editing

A group of users might be collaboratively editing parts of a software system, a
musical composition, an epic poem or whatever. They should see indications of
other active users, especially when they overlap on a part of the system. Kind
of like Google Docs but with many more kinds of "Documents".

Changes are versioned somewhat like with Git except that
- Changes correspond to tree nodes rather than line diffs
- Monotonic Changes are explicit subsets of non-monotonic changes

Ted Nelson's ideas for comparison and transclusion are supported.

*** Wicci Wiki Web

The original application envisioned for the Wicci was as a Wiki system which
- does not require policing, reverting or freezing
- allows unrestricted inexpensive forks
- supports easy intelligent merges of contributed changes

*** Contacts and Connections

The following sounds very complicated when I read it. I have a design for how
using these Connections would appear to the users (the Contacts) which would
have it all seem simple and natural. I ask for your patience with this
expression of the model!

I want to have Connections with Contacts which are easy to share, easy to use,
easy to control and update and which do not reveal any of my (or anyone else's)
personal information! When a Connection has only one other Contact and vice
versa, they will seem to be one entity but it's possible to have more than one
Contact as part of one Connection and/or to have more than one Connection
reaching the same Contact.

When I Create or Extend a Connection with a Contact I'd like the Connection to
act as a proxy for any use of it, connecting us without revealing how that
connection is being achieved. Often connections will be achieved by sharing
Wicci Documents, but it should be possible for users to specify alternate
methods such as an EMail address, Signal, etc.

Anyone sharing a Connection should be able to specify policies and constraints
for how they can be contacted. I might allow some Contacts to send me a priority
alert or ring my cellphone at any time - without revealing my cellphone number.
Other contacts might only be able to send me messages and I might or might not
allow them to assign a priority and/or allow them to track whether I've read
their message. Messages from some Contacts will go to a human or automated
assistant rather than directly to me.

Connections Channels should include realtime channels such as alerts, audio and
audiovisual connections (including conferencing). Most Channels would be
non-realtime, such as threaded messaging. A possible Channel might be physical
letter and package delivery. I might allow trusted Contacts to know my postal
address and to send me things without an OK while other Contacts would have to
request permission for each item and get a per-item authorization code and the
address of a remailing service. You can imagine other policies.

Anyone sharing a Connection should be able to change or withdraw any or all of
their Connection Channels, from specified people, roles, organizations or
groups, or everyone sharing the Connection. If someone removes all of their
Channels from a Connection they may still exist as a Tag which is associated
with their former Contacts' information.

A Connection can connect me with one or more people or organizations. A
Connection and the Contact(s) within it (more often just the latter) will
typically have metadata such as a Name, Organization, Job Position, etc.
associated with it, plus associated information such as notes, pictures, etc.
Whatever is mutually acceptable when the contact is created, including
pseudonyms.

I'll typically find Contacts (and associated Connections) using the metadata
associated with them. They can change any metadata they previously gave me, but
I can search on the old or new metadata. I can add any other metadata, e.g.
alternate Names, Tags, Folders (Tags which are part of Hierarchies) as well as
Notes and Links to a Connection or any Contact within it. Anything I add can be
kept private to me or it can be shared so as to be available to others. And with
the Wicci Model, we can collaboratively improve any associated data or metadata.

*** Posting to a Blog 

I can Post to any of my Blogs and control the Visibility and Notification of the Post.  I will often use
Categories (sets of Tags) to specify who can see a Post and/or who should be Notified of the Post.

The Wicci Model potentially allows everyone with access to a Post to comment on the Post and collaboratively 
improve the content and associated metadata (notes, tags, etc.) of the Post.  Improvements are non-destructive, 
always starting with creating (and optionally sharing) alternative Views of Content or Metadata.

** What Makes The Wicci System Special

The Wicci System is designed to create Communities where people Engage-With,
Share and Improve High-Quality Content and Services. The Wicci System is split
into two major parts (1) a Graphical User Interface running in a modern Web
Browser and (2) a back-end running inside a PostgreSQL Relational Database
Management Server (RDBMS).

Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs) and Relational Programming (via
SQL or other Relational Languages) are extraordinarily flexible, general and
elegant tools for storing and utilizing information. Most modern General-Purpose
Computing Platforms encourage developers to make use of RDBMSs in very limited
ways and they encourage developers to not learn SQL but rather to have the
Platform auto-generate it from a non-Relational source. This aversion to fully
embracing the power of Relational Systems is result of a myth that Relational
Systems do not support general (Turing Machine equivalent) computing and have a
limited set of datatypes and operators - all of which has been false for at
least 30 years, at least in the better RDBMSs.

By implementing The Wicci System's Back-End /inside/ of PostgreSQL, The Wicci
System leverages the Relational Model more than any other platform. PostgreSQL
has a highly extensible architecture and The Wicci System exploits this to allow
the Relational Model to be used more generally. The Wicci Back-End is at an
advanced stage of development.

The Wicci Front-End is intended to be lightweight, exploiting the power of the
Back-End to off-load complexity from the Front-End as much as possible, i.e.
when funcionality and decent performance does not require adding more code to
the Front-End. The Wicci Front-End is in the process of a re-design.

the Wicci System Provides
- Web Browser support for
  - Multimedia Content
  - a Graphical User Interface
- Database Integration for 
  - Persistence, Integrity, Scaling
  - Declarative Programming
  - Command & Control via SQL
- Database Extensions for
  - Metaprogramming
  - Monotonic Storage
  - Generic Operators
  - Open-Ended Document Types

And the *Killer feature*:
- Lightweight revisions called "views"
- Easily Fork, Share, Merge any content!
- Better and easier than Git!

Content Owners can 
- Control all official views
- Accept all or part of user-contributions
- Delegate selective authority to administrators
 
Users can
- Create alternative views
- Share, merge and contribute their alternative views
- Limited only by Content Owner Copyright

Views can contain diverse kinds of documents, including
- Web Pages
- Office Documents 
- Multimedia Content
- Dynamic Content
- Source Code 

Additional Features
- Language-Independent Hierarchical Symbols
- Semantic Tagging
- Semantic First-Class Links
  - Broken Links impossible
- Active DB Views
  - Table Figures in "Word Processor" Documents 
  - Spreadsheets in "Spreadsheet" Documents

The Wicci System uses a fair amount of SQL (and a little bit of C) code to add
these valuable features, making it in some ways more complex than an unenhanced
RDBMS. In another way, however, The Wicci System is simpler than most systems
using RDBMSs. Most systems based on RDBMSs make frequent use of the
non-monotonic UPDATE and DELETE operations - equivalent to altering and tearing
pages out of ledger books. Instead, the architecture of The Wicci System
supports and encourages monotonicity. Monotonicity protects information from
being lost or corrupted and makes operations simpler and more scaleable.
