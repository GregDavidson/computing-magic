* Challenges for Complex Systems and Applications

[[file:challenges.org][Solving simple puzzles]] is great for learning narrow techniques. Creating complex
systems is an entirely different challenge.

Aspects of a Complex System
- Human/Computer Interaction
      - GUI?  Command language?  AI Assistance?
      - Can GUI actions be captured as a script?
- Customizability and Settings
      - Accessibility
      - Internationalization
      - User Preferences
      - New versions offering different capabilities
      - Platform interactions
- Sessions, Checkpointing, Backup
      - Automatic checkpointing?
            - Checkpoints also are Sessions
- Resilience
      - Resilience Challenges
            - Upgrading and downgrading versions?
                  - XML and XSLT pathways?
                  - Database vs. structured files
      - Resilience Entities
            - Settings, scripts, checkpoints

Leverage Relational Database Management Systems
- Design your schemas to be
      - Functional or Monotonic
      - Versioned, e.g. Semantic Versioning
      - Multiple Versions coexisting gracefully
            - Up and Downgradable
- Consider using PostgreSQL
      - Schema changes are transactional
      - Excellent support for JSON and XML
      - and much more!
- Consider building the system /in/ the Database
      - only the user-facing interface is outside
      - and even that is mirrored in the database
