Get a Good Free Software Prolog
- there are many, here are three
      - [[https://www.swi-prolog.org/][SWI-Prolog]] Popular, easy to install or [[https://swish.swi-prolog.org/][use online]]
      - [[http://xsb.sourceforge.net/][XSB]] Integrated with Flora2 Knowledge Representation System
      - [[https://ciao-lang.org/][Ciao]] Sophisticated, multi-paradigm
- Our examples are written for SWI-Prolog

We edit Prolog using /Emacs/ in =prolog-mode= but any editor will do
- SWI-Prolog even has its [[https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pceemacs][own special editor]].

Start with these two quick reads:
- [[file:prolog-is-wild.org][Prolog Is Wild]]
- [[file:prolog-is-simple.org][Prolog Is Simple]]

Then let's solve a couple of the [[../Modules/Module-7/Problems/README.org][Module 7 AI Problems]]
- Solving the [[../Modules/Module-7/Problems/jugs.org][The Water Jug Problem]]
      - Study and run [[file:Activities/Jugs-Problem/jugs-complete.pl][jugs-complete.pl]]
      - Study and run [[file:Activities/Jugs-Problem/jugs-complete-plus.pl][jugs-complete-plus.pl]]
- How could you simplify /jugs-complete.pl/ to use one of the Shells such as
      - [[file:Activities/Shells/edepth.pl][edepth.pl]] -- domain-independent depth-first search shell
- Study the other solutions
      - [[file:Activities/Jugs-Problem/Solutions/jugs1.pl][jugs1.pl]]
      - [[file:Activities/Jugs-Problem/Solutions/jugs2.pl][jugs2.pl]]

Hints and some solutions for the remaining problems are available in the
subdirectory /Activities/.
- Try your hand at finding your own solutions!
- You might start with
      - [[file:Activities/FWGC/fwgc-hints.pl][fwgc-hints.pl]]
      - [[file:Activities/Missionaries/mission-hints.pl][mission-hints.pl]]

- Study and try using the other Shells
      - [[file:Activities/Shells/ebreadth.pl][ebreadth.pl]] -- domain-independent breadth-first search shell
      - [[file:Activities/Shells/ebest.pl][ebest.pl]] -- domain-independent best-first (heuristic) search shell
