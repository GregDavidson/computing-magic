* Prolog!

** Move Fast and Break Things!

A few or many good choices
- [[https://www.swi-prolog.org/][SWI-Prolog]] Popular, easy to install or [[https://swish.swi-prolog.org/][use online]]
- [[http://xsb.sourceforge.net/][XSB]] Integrated with Flora2 Knowledge Representation System
- [[https://ciao-lang.org/][Ciao]] Sophisticated, multi-paradigm

Our examples are written for SWI-Prolog. We use Emacs in Prolog-Mode but any
editor will do and there's also a special editor included with SWI.

Start with these two quick reads:
- [[file:prolog-is-simple.org][Prolog Is Simple]]
- [[file:prolog-is-wild.org][Prolog Is Wild]]

Then let's solve a couple of the [[../Modules/Module-7/Problems/README.org][Module 7 AI Activities Problems]]
