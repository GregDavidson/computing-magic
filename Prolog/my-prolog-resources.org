- Useful
      - Very approachable beginning.
      - Covers Prolog deep structure well
            - Unification, Resolution
      - Covers box debugging model
      - ISO Standard Prolog
      - Free on SWI-Prolog Website
      - From /Language Processing with Perl and Prolog/ by Pierre Nugues
            - which covers language understanding, translation and more!
