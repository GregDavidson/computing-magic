* The Water Jug Problem

We have a 3-liter jug and a 5-liter jug.

Our possible actions are

1. Completely fill either jug from the tap.
2. Completely empty either jug.
3. Completely fill one jug from the other, when there's enough to do that,
4. Pour all of one jug into the other, when the other can hold it all.

How can we get a desired amount of water in one of our jugs?
- e.g. How can we get exactly 4 gallons of water in the big jug?
