* The Farmer, Wolf, Goat and Cabbage Safely Cross The River

A Farmer, along with
- a Wolf
- a Goat
- a Cabbage
are on the East bank of a river.
- They all want to get to the West bank.

There's a boat which the Farmer can row across, but it only has room for 1 of the other entities at a time.

Without the Farmer present
- The Wolf will eat the Goat
- The Goat will eat the Cabbagae

The Farmer wants them all to get across the river with nothing getting eaten.
