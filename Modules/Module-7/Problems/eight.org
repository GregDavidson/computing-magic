* The Classic Eight Puzzle

There are eight tiles within a 3x3 grid. One grid
position is empty. Any tile adjacent to the empty position can be slid into
it. Can you rearrange all of the tiles into a desired configuration with a
sequence of slidings?

Simple notions:
- index :: We can number the places for the tiles, 1...9
- tiles :: We can number the tiles, 1..8
- configuration :: A mapping between the index numbers and the tile numbers

You can think of action in this world in two ways:
- A tile adjacent to the empty space moves into it
- The empty space moves up/down/right/left as long as that would not take it off of the board
You can also associate possible movements with index positions
