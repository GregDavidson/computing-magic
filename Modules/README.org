* Computing Magic Beta Notes

Notes from the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic][Computing Magic Project]] Beta Course
- [[https://mars.college][Mars College]], Q1 2022

Notes on future sessions are partly a plan for that session and partly materials
that may be useful during the meeting. *The notes are edited after each meeting*
to reflect lessons learned so be sure and re-read them a few days later! The
goal is to have *a complete set of self-paced modules suitable for self or group
learning* by the end of the quarter. We will be exploring each module with a
Group Session. In the Group Sessions there will be occasional interruptions with
enrichment pieces and feel free to ignore such if you're on a roll!
