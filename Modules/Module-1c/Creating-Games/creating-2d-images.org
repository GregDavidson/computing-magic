* Creating 2D Images for Games

** Criteria for 2D Images

2D games need 2D images
- Usually a 3D effect is desired
- Using shading, textures, etc.

We might need multiple images
- Views from different perspectives
- With different effects
- With separate parts in different orientations

** Best method: Create a 3D Model

Advantages: Allows us to
- scale the image
- rotate the image
- adjust object composition during game play
- view the image from different perspectives
Disadvantages:
- Requires sophisticated graphics programming skills.

** Alternative method: Create it using a 2D Graphics Toolkit

Advantages: Allows us to
- scale the image
- rotate the image
- adjust object composition during game play
Disadvantages:
- Requires graphics programming skills.

- Can't automatically provide multiple 3D perspectives.

Racket has several powerful 2D drawing toolkits

** Good Manual method: Create an SVG Image

Advantages:
- SVG images are
      - scalable
      - rotatable
      - fairly easy to edit
Disadvantages:
- SVG images are only 2D
      - 3D effects in SVGs only work for one perspective
      - Animation through editing is limited

A good Open Source Free Software SVG Image editor is
- [[https://inkscape.org][Inkscape]]

** Easiest method: Import existing Bitmaps

- Advantage: We can get started right away
      - And switch to more sophisticated images later.
- Disadvantages:
      - Not fully scalable or rotatable
            - Resolution is fixed
            - Jagged edges emerge when scaling
      - Animation is limited
            - Images can be broken up into parts
            - Images can be switched in and out
      - We have to find or create suitable bitmap images
            - Harder to edit than SVG images

Two good Open Source Free Software Bitmap Image editors are
- [[https://krita.org][Krita]] :: Excellent and fairly easy to learn and use
- [[https://www.gimp.org][The GIMP]] :: More sophisticated but more difficult to learn and use
