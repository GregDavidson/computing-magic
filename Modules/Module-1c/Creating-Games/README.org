* Creating Games R&D Folder

This folder contains experiments in creating games with Racket.

Mostly the code here is testing out ideas.

Do not assume that anything here is suitable for use!

** How can we unify Racket 2D graphics systems?

Racket has several systems
- pict
- metapict
  - almost compatible with pict except for coordinate axes
- 2htdp/image
  - works with 2htdp/universe
- svg handling

Can we make pict compatible with
- 2htdp/universe -- making 2htdp/image unnecessary?
- 2htdp/image -- adding functionality to pict?

The [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/overview.html][racket/draw]] library is
- based on the PostScript drawing model
- implemented with Cairo???

Can Cairo allow us to
- Provide first-class support for svg???
