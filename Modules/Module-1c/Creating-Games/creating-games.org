* Let's Create a Video Game!

** What's Our Plan?

Creating /Interactive Computer Games/ is a great way to learn /GeneraL
Programming Skills/, including /Program Design/ - so let's do it!

Wait, doesn't this require learning a lot of complicated things first?
- Not so much with [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]]
- and the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack][How to Design Programs Teachpacks]]
created by the wonderful Racket Developers!

Creating games with Racket and the Racket Teachpacks will prepare you to
- Create challenging programs using any decent computer language
- Exploit any reasonable programming libraries or frameworks

The Initial Path
1. Animate some 2D graphics
2. Create a single-player interactive video game
3. Add some interesting features

Optional Advanced Paths
- Add advanced features
      - Complex objects
      - Multimedia
      - etc.
- Create a 3D Graphics Game
- Create a multi-player game

** Prerequisites

Prerequisite for this tutorial: [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/tree/main/Modules/Module-1#readme][Computing Magic Module 1]]
- The essential part of which is completing the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick][Racket Quick Tutorial]] through Step 8.
- and we recommend you complete the whole of Module 1 including [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/blob/main/Modules/Module-1/Exercises/Make-A-Face/make-a-face.rkt.org][Making A Face]].

** Acknowledgements

This tutorial is inspired by the material in the two books
- [[https://htdp.org][How To Design Programs]]
- [[https://world.cs.brown.edu][How To Design Worlds]]
The main differences in this tutorial is that
- We mostly present code first and explain the theory afterwards.
- We use the full Racket Language rather than a limited Student Language.

We also owe a great debt to
- The wonderful [[https://racket-lang.org][Racket]] developers
- The pioneers who made /Computing Magic/ possible
