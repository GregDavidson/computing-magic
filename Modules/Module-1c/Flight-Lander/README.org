* Flight Lander

This the Second Starting Point for [[file:../README.org][Writing 2D Games]].
- It follows [[file:../Falling-To-Flying/README.org][Falling To Flying]]

1. Open the program [[file:flight-lander-0.rkt][flight-lander-0.rkt]] with DrRacket.
2. Run the program.
3. Study the Code
   - Use F1 to look up any unfamiliar features!
4.  Explore the suggested exercises, questions and issues.

** Prepare Flight Lander for a Multi-User Game

You'll want to have more than one interactively controllable sprite.

Here are some ideas:

1. Make the Balloon into an Interactive Hot Air Balloon.
       - Have a hot-key turn it's burner on and off.
       - Show a flame when the burner is on.
       - Give it an upwards thrust when the burner is on.
       - When the burner is off, have it cool and lose altitude.
       - Have winds at different elevations so you can navigate the balloon.

2. Create a Missile Sprite.
       - You can borrow ideas from
             - our earlier  [[file:../Falling-To-Flying/README.org][Falling To Flying]] programs
       - Our Airplane Sprite
       - Our Balloon Sprite

3. Create a Missile Launcher
       - This could be part of another sprite!

Can you see how each of these interactive Sprites could potentially
be controlled by a separate user in a Multi-User game?

As soon as you're ready, go to the [[file:../Network-Volley/README.org][Network Volley]] Starting Point to learn how to
make games multi-user. Once you understand the techniques, you can make your
Flight Lander program Multi-User!
