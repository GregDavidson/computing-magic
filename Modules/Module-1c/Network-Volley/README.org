* Network Volley - Interactive Multi-User Games

This the third Starting Point for [[file:../README.org][Writing 2D Games]].

We're going to learn how to create games which
- Consist of multiple Client Programs called /Worlds/
- Worlds will be coordinated by a /Universe Server/
- We can design and test it on a single computer
- Given an accessible network Universe Server
- Multiple Users can interact with Worlds running on their own machines

Open these example programs in 2 DrRacket tabs or windows:
- [[file:ball-toss-client.rkt][ball-toss-client.rkt]]
- [[file:ball-toss-server.rkt][ball-toss-server.rkt]]

Once you have the Universe Server running you can test the World Server
as indicated at the bottom of the code.

Explore both programs
- By running them
- By studying the code
- Consulting the documentation on the new procedures

Add some features!

When you're ready, use the techniques from our earlier starting points to create
a rich Multi-User Universe
- See the last section of the [[file:../Flight-Lander/README.org][Flight Lander]] Starting Point!
