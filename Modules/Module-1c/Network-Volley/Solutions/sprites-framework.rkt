;; ** Definitions

;; *** IDs and ID Maps

;; Details below at ** IDs and ID Maps

;; Unique Keys associate Sprite Proxies with Sprites
;; Because Sprites are associated with a specific World
;; - the keys can be a combination of a world-id and a sprite-id

(define world-id? natural?)
(define world-id->string number->string)

(define sprite-id? natural?)

;; world-sprites map sprite-ids to sprites

;; universes map universe-ids to worlds
;; either iworld or world-sprites

;; **** Sprite Proxies

;; Sprite Proxies represent new sprites or
;; changes to existing sprites.

;; Implementation below: ** Sprite Proxies

;; **** Parameters, Tracing and Testing

;; Tracing controls the display of runtime information
;; to aid in understanding and debugging the programs.

;; Testing Mode has the program behave in a manner
;; which is simpler to study and debug.  E.g. the
;; sprites won't move without explicit boosting.

;; Implementation below: ** Tracing and Testing

;; **** Client-Server Message Types

;; a param structure provides context needed to
;; run functions to create or update foreign sprites.

;; messages carry information between a
;; world and a universe server or between
;; worlds when relayed by a universe server

;; an update can describe a sprite to drop
;; a sprite to create or a sprite to change

;; an action structure associates a context,
;; i.e. a world-id or a params-base structure
;; with a list of updates.

;; *** Parameters, Tracing and Testing

;; fix the problems with the make-parameter guard
;; - ensure it is applied to the initial value
;; - ensure it returns the value it has checked
;; - allow value to initially be #f
(define (my-parameter value guard name [check-name #f])
  (define (string x) (format "~a" x))
  (define (check v)
    (unless (guard v)
      (raise-argument-error name
                            (string (or check-name (object-name guard) 'check))
                            v ) )
    v )
  (make-parameter (and value (check value)) check name) )

;; the parameter *tracing* can be set to
;; #f = don't trace anywhere
;; #t = trace everywhere
;; set of function names (symbols) = trace only those functions

;; ==> Use *tracing* with the function tracing!

;; (tracing) = return #t if *tracing* is #t, false otherwise
;; (tracing name) = return #t if *tracing* is #t
;;   or *tracing* is a set of function names including name

(define *tracing* (my-parameter #f (or/c boolean? generic-set?) 'tracing))

(define (tracing [name #f])

;; In testing mode, disable any required user interactions
;; in particular, disable falling!
(define *testing* (my-parameter #f boolean? 'testing))

;; *** Key <-> Value Associations

;; In several places we need to have mappings between keys and values. As long
;; as these sets aren't too large, we can use alists, i.e. lists of cons pairs
;; where the car is a key and the cdr is the value.

;; Typically these associations are stored in fixed fields of particular fixed
;; or variable structures or other composite objects, so we provide some meta
;; functions to create custom functions to do these operations conveniently.

;; If the value is in the list, return the list as is, otherwise return an
;; extended list with that value added. Note that val~elem? may be asymmetric in
;; comparing the value with a list element!
(define (ensure-list-value lst val [val~elem? equal?])
  (let ( [found (member val lst val~elem?)] )
    (if found lst (cons val lst))) )

;; Given the key, return the val part of the (key . val) element in the
;; association list. Returns not-found if the key is not found!
(define (alist-key->val alist key [is-equal? equal?] [not-found #f])
  (let ( [found (assoc key alist is-equal?)] )
    (if found (cdr found) not-found) ) )

;; Given the val, return the key part of the (key . val) element in the
;; association list. Returns not-found if the val is not found!
(define (alist-val->key alist val [is-equal? equal?] [not-found #f])
  (let ( [found (memf (位 (pair) (is-equal? (cdr pair) val)) alist)] )
    (if found (caar found) not-found) ) )

;; Create and return the three essential procedures
;; to manage an alist stored in an object's field.
(define (obj-alist-procs obj getter setter!
                         [pair~elem? equal?]
                         [key-compare? equal?]
                         [val-compare? equal?] )
  (values
   (位 (key val)
     (setter! obj (ensure-list-value (getter obj) (cons key val) pair~elem?)) )
   (位 (key) (alist-key->val (getter obj) key key-compare?))
   (位 (val) (alist-val->key (getter obj) val val-compare?)) ) )

;; *** gvec maps ids to values just right

;; Given IDs which are small contiguous numbers
;; we can use gvector to manage collections of
;; - IDs mapped to Values, e.g.
;; - worldsprites: sprites indexed sprite-ids
;; - universes: world-sprites indexed by world-ids

;; We'll customize gvector to have exactly the
;; semantics we want and call the result gvec!

;; gvec ids will be automatically reused, smallest
;; first, so the underlying gvector won't grow
;; until it must.

;; Make a new gvec with a default initial capacity
;; or with just enough room to hold a given index.

;; EXERCISE: Replace this O(n) algorithm with an O(1) algorithm

;; Clue: An O(1) algorithm is straightforward if
;; 1. The vector contents aren't numbers
;; 2. An extra slot is always available at the end
;; 3. The extra slots "point at each other" from lowest to highest, circularly
;; Examples:
;; an empty gvec: (gvector 0)
;; a gvec with 2 slots available for reuse:
;;   (gvector 'item0 3 'item2 5 'item4 1)
;; the end -> position 1 -> position 3 --> the end
;; pronouncing -> as "points to"

;; Return first index of item in gvec or #f if none.

;; *** Sprite Proxies

;; We need to be able to send sprites across worlds.
;; This requires us to serialize them, i.e. convert them to a byte stream.
;; Alas, Racket doesn't provide for serialization of
;; - regular structures, images or procedures

;; A serializable-struct can be serialized if all of their components
;; can be serialized.  Alas, the 2htdp/universe package won't accept
;; serializable structures!  It will accept lists, vectors and
;; prefab structures.

;; We can represent images either by
;; (1) a filesystem path to a stored image
;; (2) a symbol representing a function which
;;     takes a params structure and returns an image.
;; Procedures will be represented by their names (symbols).
;; A sprite-proxy will have the same key as the sprite it is a proxy for.
;; Only the key field is required.  The other fields can default to #f if
;; the corresponding sprite field is irrelevant, i.e. not requiring an update.
(struct sprite-proxy (sprite image x y dx dy on-tick on-key to-draw)
