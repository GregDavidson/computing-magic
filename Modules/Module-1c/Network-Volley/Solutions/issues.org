** id-partially-applied

Something is going wrong with my contract checking

*** With DrRacket debug I get

../../../../../../../../usr/local/SW.d/racket-8.13/collects/racket/contract/private/provide.rkt:185:32: id-partially-applied49: undefined;
 cannot reference an identifier before its definition

which seems to finger the contract system

*** Provisional Bug Report:

title:

Need clue: Error "id-partially-applied49.1 undefined", no such symbol in my source!

body:

sprites-worlds-game.rkt brings in
```
#lang racket/base
(require racket/math
         racket/list
         racket/set
         racket/bool
         racket/function
         racket/stream
         data/gvector )
```
Thanks for any help locating where to look!
