;; ** Grouping World Parameters in an Immutable Structure

;; Parameters can be bound in the global environment
;; or they can be made part of the world state.

;; Global bindings are good if they are constant
;; after program initialization.

;; If we need to supply specific parameters to
;; procedures running in other worlds
;; (or other threads) then it's better to group
;; them in structures and pass them explicitly
;; to those procedures.

;; Such grouped parameters can also become part of
;; our World State.

;; moved to the sprites-worlds-games.rkt module.
