* NEW: Adding Animation to our Game

Currently our Sprites get their shape from a single image.

Other possibilities include
- Updating a sprite's shape
- Replacing a sprite with a differently shaped sprite
- Replacing the image with a function which draws a custom image
      - Based on the sprite's state and the state of the world
- Replacing the single shape with a set of shapes
      - The complete shape is a combination of multiple component shapes
      - e.g. hands, arms, legs, etc.
      - Component shapes can change their positioning

This is all very open-ended and we'll explore some of these options in projects
and examples to come!
