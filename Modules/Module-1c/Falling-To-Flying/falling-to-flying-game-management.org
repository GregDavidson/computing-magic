* NEW: Game Management

Games can be managed through the =big-bang= clauses

- (on-tick tick-expr ...)
      - The tick-expr procedure should handle all game management
      - It can do more than just call the on-tick methods of the game sprites
      - The world state can hold more than just the sprite list
- (stop-when last-world? ...)
      - The last-world? procedure can stop the game based on the world state.
- (close-on-stop cos-expr)
      - Controls whether and for how long the game window remains visible after
        the game has stopped.

We'll explore some variations.
