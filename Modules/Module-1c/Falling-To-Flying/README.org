* Falling To Flying

This is the Starting Point for writing 2D games.

You can find the initial complete program in
- [[file:falling-to-flying-0.rkt][falling-to-flying-0.rkt]]

- Open it with DrRacket
- Run it
- Study the code
- Use F1 to get help on the new functions and libraries
- Change some things, e.g.
      - Create something else to drop using 2htdp/image functions
      - Or load a bitmap with =bitmap/file= or =bitmap/url=

The =big-bang= function is our game engine and it has many features we're going
to explore in further exercises. Most of its job is to call functions which you
write. Look over its documentation. Don't be worried if you don't understand
everything it does yet!

Now let's make the program more sophisticated by:
- [[file:falling-to-flying-state.org][Adding State]]
      - Sprites with custom properties
- [[file:falling-to-flying-interaction.org][Adding Interactivity]]
      - Self-Managing Interactive Sprites
- [[file:falling-to-flying-multiple-sprites.org][Multiple Sprites]]
      - A world of multiple interactive sprites
            - each with their own appearance and behavior
- [[file:falling-to-flying-animation.org][Adding Animation]]
      - Sprites with Changeable Structure
- [[file:falling-to-flying-end-goal.org][Adding an End Goal]]
      - How do we bring a game to an end?

Once you've finished these improvements and your own creative
ideas, it's time to move on to
- [[file:../Flight-Lander/README.org][Flight Lander]] :: Interacting Sprites!
      - Sprites which interact with one another
      - as well as with the user!
