* Falling To Flying

This is the Starting Point for writing 2D games.

- Open [[file:falling-to-flying-0.rkt][falling-to-flying-0.rkt]] with DrRacket
- Run it
- Study the code
- Use the =F1= key to get help on the new functions and libraries
- Change some things, e.g.
      - Create something else to drop using 2htdp/image functions
      - Or load a bitmap with =bitmap/file= or =bitmap/url=

The [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#%28form._world._%28%28lib._2htdp%2Funiverse..rkt%29._big-bang%29%29][big-bang]] function will be the heart of our game engine
- Initially we'll only use a few of its features
- Most of its job is to call your functions!
- Look over [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#%28form._world._%28%28lib._2htdp%2Funiverse..rkt%29._big-bang%29%29][its documentation]]
- Don't be worried if you don't understand everything it does yet!

Now let's make the program more sophisticated by:
- [[file:falling-to-flying-state.org][Adding State]] - Sprites with custom properties
- [[file:falling-to-flying-interaction.org][Adding Interactivity]] - Self-Managing Interactive Sprites
- [[file:falling-to-flying-multiple-sprites.org][Multiple Sprites]] - A world of multiple interactive sprites
      - each with their own appearance and behavior
- [[file:falling-to-flying-animation.org][Adding Animation]] - Sprites with Changeable Structure
- [[file:falling-to-flying-game-management.org][Game Management]]
      - How do we assess progress?
      - How does a game end?

Once you've finished these improvements and your own creative
ideas, it's time to move on to
- [[file:../Flight-Lander/README.org][Flight Lander]]
      - Sprites which interact with one another
      - as well as with the user!
