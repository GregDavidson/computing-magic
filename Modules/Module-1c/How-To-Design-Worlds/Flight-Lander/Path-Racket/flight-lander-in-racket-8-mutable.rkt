;; * Flight Lander Game, Version (2htdp Lang Racket)

;; ** Overview

;; Imperative Programming used sparingly.
;; Sprites are mutable values.

;; *** Exercises

;; Throughout the code there are several suggested
;; exercises marked with EXERCISE: which will make
;; this framework better.

;; Double and triple question ?? and exclamation !!
;; marks signal issues which should be addressed.

;; Iterate:
;; - Make this framework better.
;; - Imagine cool new features for this game and
;;   other games you could build using this framework.
;; - Try to add those new features and/or
;;   build those other games.
;; - How does this framework help you and
;;   what would make it better?

;; *** The Current Game

;; The plane moves left-to-right, wrapping
;; - the plane slowly descends
;; - up/down keys give extra vertical motion
;; - game ends when landed or sunk to the bottom
;; + sinking is slow
;; + almost landed plane falls back into the water

;; inspired by Chapter 5 of the Tutorial
;;   How to Design Worlds https://world.cs.brown.edu/
;; brought up to date with the 2nd edition of
;;   How To Design Programs https://htdp.org/

;; Stylistic comment:
;; Global immutable non-procedures are in UPPER-CASE

;; ** The Data Structures

;; Most lisp dialects provide a handy macro for defining
;; structures, i.e. objects with named fields.

;; Racket provides struct which has a #:guard clause for
;; checking structure validity when a structure is constructed,
;; but does nothing when the structure is mutated.

;; Racket also provides the more sophisticated struct/contract
;; which allows more general contracts to be expressed to
;; ensure a structure's validity.  And the syntax is nicer!

;; *** simple-sprite - Image + Position

;; A simple-sprite represents an image at a position in a 2D scene.

;; Our x and y values designate the bottom left corner
;; of the object's bounding box.

;; WARNING: The image drawing toolkit uses the
;; coordinates of the center of the image's bounding
;; box to draw it!

;; WARNING: Our guards allow x and y values which exceed
;; the scene's width and height in order to allow creating
;; values which signal that an object has gone off scene.
;; Is this a good idea??  What might be alternatives??

(struct/contract simple-sprite
                 ( [image image?] [x natural?] [y natural?] )
                 #:mutable #:transparent )

;; *** sprite - Image Object Structure

;; A sprite adds dx and dy values for movement, along with an update
;; method for creating a new sprite, e.g. on a clock tick.

;; The 'update-sprite! function below may be easier to use than the automatically
;; created 'sprite constructor which requires values for all of the fields!

;; Create an update-function which returns its object unchanged.
;; This can be used for sprites which don't want to do anything
;; on update.
(define (update-identity x) x)

(struct/contract sprite simple-sprite
                 ( [dx integer?] [dy integer?] [update procedure?] )
                 #:mutable #:transparent )

;; *** abstract-sprite, synonyms and update-sprite!

;; The two struct types simple-sprite and sprite are related.
;; abstract-sprite can be either one.

(define (abstract-sprite? obj) (or (simple-sprite? obj) (sprite? obj)))

;; Create sprite synonyms for the simple-sprite deconstructors
(define sprite-image simple-sprite-image)
(define sprite-left simple-sprite-x)      ; x value of left edge
(define sprite-bottom simple-sprite-y)    ; y value of bottom edge
;; Create sprite synonyms for the simple-sprite mutators
(define set-sprite-image! set-simple-sprite-image!)
(define set-sprite-x! set-simple-sprite-x!)    ; x value of left edge
(define set-sprite-y! set-simple-sprite-y!)    ; y value of bottom edge

;; Update an existing-sprite, mutating the specified field values.
(define (update-sprite! target-sprite
         ;; optional new values for simple-sprite fields
         #:image [new-image #f] #:x [new-x #f] #:y [new-y #f]
         ;; optional new values for sprite fields
         #:dx [new-dx #f] #:dy [new-dy #f] #:update [new-update #f] )

  (when new-dy (set-sprite-dy! target-sprite new-dy))
  (when new-update (set-sprite-update! target-sprite new-update))
  (void) )

;; *** Additional simple-sprite property functions

;; We'll often need to split an integer in half,
;; note that it will be off by 1 for odd numbers:
;;   (half 5) --> 2
;; This is because we're working with exact pixel counts.
;; Question: How can we hide this problem??
(define (half x) (quotient x 2))

(define sprite-width (compose image-width sprite-image))
(define sprite-height (compose image-height sprite-image))
(define sprite-half-width (compose half sprite-width))
(define sprite-half-height (compose half sprite-height))
(define (sprite-center-x s) (+ (sprite-left s) (sprite-half-width s)))
(define (sprite-center-y s) (- (sprite-bottom s) (sprite-half-height s)))
;; Are the right and top edges part of the object or bounds??
(define (sprite-right s) (+ (sprite-left s) (sprite-width s))) ; right edge
(define (sprite-top s) (- (sprite-bottom s) (sprite-height s))) ; top edge

;; ** Overlap And Collision Detection

;; We consider three methods for detecting whether two sprites
;; collide
;; (1) Best method: Check if any non-transparent pixels overlap.
;;     Alas, this is expensive to compute and challenging to program.
;; (2) They get close enough that the distance between their centers
;;     is less than some minimum.
;;     Alas, we'll get false negatives, i.e. cases where the sprites
;;     are visually colliding but our algorithm won't trigger.
;; (3) Cheapest method: Check if the bounding boxes of the two
;;     sprites overlap.
;;     Alas, we'll get false positives, i.e. cases where the sprites
;;     only overlap their transparent regions, but our algorithm
;;     will trigger.

;; Method (2) is recommended by the How To Design Worlds tutorial.

;; A combination of (3) and (1) will work better than (2).
;; So let's go with (3) and enhance it with (1) later.

;; *** Check if the sprites bounds overlap

;; Note: Be sure that all sprite images are trimmed within their
;; bounding boxes!

; do the bounding boxes of these two sprites overlap?
(define (sprite-bounds-overlap? a b)
  (and (ranges-overlap? (sprite-left a) (sprite-right a) (sprite-left b) (sprite-right b))
       (ranges-overlap? (sprite-top a) (sprite-bottom a) (sprite-top b) (sprite-bottom b)) ) )

;; For testing purposes
(define (show-overlap a b)
  (let ( [x1a (sprite-left a)] [x2a (sprite-right a)] [x1b (sprite-left b)] [x2b (sprite-right b)]
         [y2a (sprite-top a)] [y1a (sprite-bottom a)] [y2b (sprite-top b)] [y1b (sprite-bottom b)] )
    (let ( [x? (ranges-overlap? x1a x2a x1b x2b)]
           [y? (ranges-overlap? y2a y1a y2b y1b)] )
      (begin
        (printf "a x: [~a .. ~a) b x: [~a .. ~a) --> ~a\n"
                x1a x2a x1b x2b x? )
        (printf "a y: [~a .. ~a) b y: [~a .. ~a) --> ~a\n"
                y2a y1a y2b y1b y? )
        (printf "overlap? ~a\n" (and x? y?)) ) ) ) )

;; |---- Range 1 ------|
;;                 |--- Range 2 -----|                          _

;; check that the bounds of one object are in ascending ordered
(define (assert-ascending bound1 bound2 name)
  (unless (< bound1 bound2)
    (error (format "Failed expectation ~a in ascending order: ~a ~a" name bound1 bound2)) ) )

;; Does this handle all the possible cases??
;; Needs the bounds to be in ascending order.
;; Should the test be < or <= and why?
(define (ranges-overlap? start1 end1 start2 end2)
  (assert-ascending start1 end1 'first)
  (assert-ascending start2 end2 'second)
  (< (max start1 start2) (min end1 end2)) )

;; *** Check if the pixels of the sprites overlap

;; Challenging coding project: Write this function properly!
;; The comments here explain what needs to be coded
;; and why it's challenging!

;; It's too expensive to examine all of the pixels of
;; two sprites individually, testing for overlap.

;; First: Make sure that all of the pixels of our images which are not part of
;; the shape of the sprite are alpha-encoded as transparent.

;; Second: When a new image becomes part of a sprite, construct a set of
;; bit-vectors indicating which corresponding pixels of the image are part of
;; the shape of the object. Assume that any non-enclosed transparent part of the
;; image is not part of the shape of the sprite.

;; Third: Cache the set of bit-vectors as part of the sprite. When a new sprite
;; is created from an existing sprite without changing the image, save the
;; bit-vector in the new sprite.

;; Have sprite-images-collide? perform appropriate bitwise intersections
;; between the appropriate bit-vectors of the two overlapping images,
;; shifting the bit-vectors as needed to align.

;; For now, we'll just put it in as a stub, as it will only be used after we
;; check that the bounding boxes overlap, anyway.

(define (sprite-images-collide? a b) #t)

;; *** Putting our methods together

(define (sprites-collide? a b)
  (and (sprite-bounds-overlap? a b)
       (sprite-images-collide? a b) ) )

(define (sprite-collides? sprite world)
  (ormap (Î» (s) (and (not (eq? s sprite)) (sprites-collide? sprite s))) world) )

;; ** Placing Sprites on Images

;; Like place-image, but relative to the lower-left corner
;; rather than the x and y centers of the image being placed.
(define (place-image-lower-left top-image x y bottom-image)
  (let ( [center-x (+ x (half (image-width top-image)))]
         [center-y (- y (half (image-height top-image)))] )
    (place-image top-image center-x center-y bottom-image) ) )

(define (simple-place-sprite sprite scene)
  (let ( [image (sprite-image sprite)]
         [x (sprite-left sprite)]
         [y (sprite-bottom sprite)] )
    (place-image-lower-left image x y scene) ) )

;; Wrap the image around the x axis:
;; When the image is partially off-scene,
;; draw the two parts, clipped.
;; THIS IS NOT WORKING YET!!!
(define (wrapping-place-sprite sprite scene)
  (let ( [image (sprite-image sprite)]
         [x (sprite-left sprite)]
         [y (sprite-bottom sprite)] )
    (let ( [first-image (place-image-lower-left image x y scene)]
           [shift-x (- x (image-width scene))] )
      (if (not (> (sprite-right sprite) (image-width scene)))
          first-image
          (place-image-lower-left image shift-x y image) ) ) ) )

;; EXERCISE: Switch place-sprite to use wrapping-place-sprite
;;           and get it to work properly for split images!
;; HINT: Run these expressions at the REPL:
#;(simple-place-sprite
   (update-sprite! PLANE
                   #:x (- SCENE-WIDTH (half (sprite-width PLANE)))
                   #:y BASE-TOP ) BACKGROUND )

                    #:x (- SCENE-WIDTH (half (sprite-width PLANE)))

;; Tests

;; Purposes of tests
;; 1. They give examples of how things are supposed to work.
;;    which helps us understand our program better.
;;    They therefore help document the program.
;;    And unlike comments, they can't lie!
;; 2. They check that things are working the way we expect
;;    them to work which helps us avoid bugs.
;;    This is especially useful in catching bugs someone might
;;    accidentally create later when they're evolving the program
;;    to do interesting new things.

;; Ideally our tests would make sure that our program does all
;; of the things we want it to do and that it won't accidentally
;; do anything we don't want it to do.  There are ways to write
;; tests which approach this ideal without having to write a
;; ridiculous amount of tests!

;; EXERCISE: Add more useful tests!
