;; ** Placing Images

;; Notes
;; - In the 2htdp/image library
;;   - images are placed relative to a "keyhole"
;;   - keyholes default to the centers of their bounding boxes
;;   - scenes are like images but lack keyholes
;;   - the horizontal scene x coordinates increases left-to-right from 0
;;   - the vertical scene y coordinate increases top-to-bottom from 0
;; - We prefer to
;;   - ignore the keyhole concept
;;   - place images relative to the lower left of their bounding boxes
;;   We could simplify our code if we made scene and image coordinates the same
;;   - i.e. relative to their lower left.
;;   - we have not yet chosen to do this, hence a few minus signs are required.

;; half is used to halve sizes in pixels
;; - it gives an inexact result for odd integers
;; - consider making all image sizes even!!
(define (half x) (quotient x 2))

;; place an image onto a scene at a specified scene location
;; location is relative to
;; the lower left of the image
;; the upper left of the scene
;; a wrapper around place-image which is relative to
;; the center of the image
(define (ll-place-image top-image x y bottom-scene)
  (let ( [center-x (+ x (half (image-width top-image)))]
         [center-y (- y (half (image-height top-image)))] )
    (place-image top-image center-x center-y bottom-scene) ) )

;; ** The Background

;; We're following the convention of using
;; UPPER-KEBOB-CASE for constants.

(define WIDTH 800)  ; the width of the scene
(define HEIGHT 500) ; the height of the scene
(define BASE-HEIGHT 50) ; the height of the land and the water
(define BASE-Y (- HEIGHT BASE-HEIGHT))  ; the start of the base, from the top
(define WATER-WIDTH (truncate (* 5/8 WIDTH)))
;; verticle distance to move the plane when you press a key
(define KEY-DISTANCE 15)

;; Using these constants, hereâ€™s an image to represent water:
(define WATER (rectangle WATER-WIDTH BASE-HEIGHT "solid" "blue"))
;; and another one to represent land:
(define LAND (rectangle (- WIDTH WATER-WIDTH) BASE-HEIGHT "solid" "brown"))
