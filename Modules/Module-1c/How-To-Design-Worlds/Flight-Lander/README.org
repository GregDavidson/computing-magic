* Flight Lander Game

From Chapter 5 of the Tutorial
- [[https://world.cs.brown.edu][How to Design Worlds (HTDW)]]
Based on the 1st edition of
- [[https://htdp.org][How to Design Programs (HTDP)]]

HTDW is a great tutorial to writing games, with some issues
- It uses a graphics library obsoleted by the 2nd edition of HTDP
- Programming is limited by the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/index.html][Racket Student Languages]]
- It assumes we're using the DrRacket editor with its ability to embed images in
  a program's source.

** 1HTDP-ASL

A sequence of example programs based on the old 1st edition of
- [[https://htdp.org][How To Design Programs (HTDP)]]
- Using HTDP's [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/advanced.html][Advanced Student Language]]
- Requires you to use DrRacket for embedded images.

Utility: It follows the HTDW text closely.

** 2HTDP-ASL

A sequence of solutions based on
- the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdp2htdp.html][2htdp libraries of HTDP 2nd Edition]]
- still using HTDP's [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/advanced.html][Advanced Student Language]]
- still requires DrRacket for embedded images.

You can compare these examples with the 1HTDP originals.

** 2HTDP-Racket

A sequence of solutions based on
- the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdp2htdp.html][2htdp libraries of HTDP 2nd Edition]]
- still using HTDP's [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/advanced.html][Advanced Student Language]]
- Using the full Racket Language
      - ~#lang racket~
- You can use any editor and development environment
      - DrRacket is still a good choice!

** Sprite-Racket

We now start to create a more powerful game architecture.
- We refactor the simple world of
      - Lots of global values
      - A world of numeric positions
Into a world of
- Sprites :: Active Mutable Graphical Objects

Sprites will allow us to have
- more sophisticated features
- with less complexity!

We carefully use some [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic/blob/main/Racket/imperative-racket.rkt][Racket Imperative Features]]
- beginning with [[file:Sprite-Racket/flight-lander-in-racket-9-mutable.rkt][flight-lander-in-racket-9-mutable.rkt]]
- but only Sprites will be mutable!

** Resources

The old airplane shows up as an outline underwater when using the
original teachpack.  It doesn't show up at all when using the
2htdp/image teachpack.  The solution was to create the modified
airplane image.

- original airplane from HTDW :: airplane-small.png
- modified airplane :: airplane-small-clipped-alpha.png
      - clipped to the edges
      - outside area turned transparent with an alpha channel
