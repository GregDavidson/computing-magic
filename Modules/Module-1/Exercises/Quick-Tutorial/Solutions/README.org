* Variations of the Code from the Quick Tutorial

The Racket files in this Directory are variations of the code from
- [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick][Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures]]

*You should do the tutorial first!* and then perhaps read [[file:quick-annotated.rkt][quick-annotated.rkt]].

The variations

- [[file:quick-0.rkt][quick-0.rkt]] :: The original code with a few comments.
      - It uses #lang slideshow
- [[file:quick-annotated.rkt][quick-annotated.rkt]] :: The original code with lots of explanatory comments.
      - It still uses #lang slideshow
- [[file:quick-racket-base.rkt][quick-racket-base.rkt]] :: Using #lang racket/base + (require pict)
- [[file:quick-scheme.rkt][quick-scheme.rkt]] :: Using #lang scheme + (require pict)
