* Computing Magic Beta Module 1

/Acquiring a Lisp/

Based on a [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic][Computing Magic]] [[file:mars-beta-notes.org][Beta Course]] Meeting.

** Programming with Pictures

Programming is best learned by Exploring, that is to say
1. Read a bit, e.g. from a Tutorial
2. Replicate the examples
3. Experiment a bit beyond the examples
4. Look up a few things in the Reference Manual
5. Repeat with step 1!

Explore the [[https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/][Quick Tutorial]]
- As you try each example
      - Try variations
      - Play and Explore
- Complete the tutorial at least through Step 8.
- If you would like some support, please seek out any of
      - =Touch=, =Alejandro=, =pseudo= or another enthusiast
      - and allow us to assist you!
 
** What else might you do?

The program [[file:../Racket/Tutorial-1-Pictures/after-quick.rkt][after-quick.rkt]] shows some variations on the code you explored with
the /Quick Tutorial/.

This course is self-paced, so feel free to continue on to later modules in
