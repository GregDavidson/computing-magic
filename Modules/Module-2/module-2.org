* Computing Magic Beta Module 2
  
/Tooling Up/

Based on notes from a [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic][Computing Magic]] [[mars-beta-notes.org][Beta Course]] Meeting.

** Software Development Power Tools

This module and the next are focused on setting up and learning some major
productivity tools.

Let's start with =git=, /GitHub/ and =emacs=.
   
*** Git, Github
   
- Software is eating the world
- Git is eating software-development
- GitHub is the main /watering-hole/ for sharing Git Projects
- /resistance is futile!/
      - not really, there are alternatives
      - it's still a very good idea to learn these popular tools!

If you don't yet have a GitHub account
- [[https://github.com/join][Create a GitHub Account]]

Create some GitHub repositories
- A private repository, suggested name: =Notes=
- A public repository for Computing Magic
- More repositories for your other projects

Use [[file:../Software-Tools/git-readme.org][Git README]] to install and learn how to exploit Git for your projects

Clone your GitHub repositories onto your working computers 

*** Emacs: Lisp as a Platform 

See the [[file:../Software-Tools/Emacs/emacs-readme.org][Emacs README]] to install and begin to learn a nice Emacs and Emacs
environment.

- Getting Started with Emacs
      - Pick something you'd like to write up
      - Read up a bit on [[https://orgmode.org][OrgMode]]
      - Do the Emacs Tutorial (Control-H Capitol-T)
      - Create your document using OrgMode in one of your repositories
- Commit your file
      - Try it with basic git commands
      - Try it with =magit= within Emacs
- Make changes and
      - lather, rinse, repeat!

** What else might you do?

Use [[file:../Software-Tools/scripting-readme.org][Scripting README]] to install and learn powerful scripting tools
