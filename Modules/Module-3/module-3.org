* Computing Magic Beta Meeting 3
  
/Practicing the Art/
  
/Mars, Monday 7 February 2022/

Notes from a [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic][Computing Magic]] [[mars-beta-notes.org][Beta Course]] Meeting.

** Open Lab

Using the support of our Computing Magic Community, move forward in the projects
which interest you.

Touch will occasionally ask for our attention to present an enrichment piece or
address a common question.

Whatever you explore, you become a resource!

Strategic things to work on are in the following sections

*** Git Repositories

Use [[file:../Software-Tools/git-readme.org][Git README]] to install and learn how to exploit Git for your projects
    
*** Emacs and OrgMode

Use [[file:../Software-Tools/Emacs/emacs-readme.org][Emacs README]] to install and learn a nice Emacs and Emacs environment.

*** Scripting Tools

Use [[file:../Software-Tools/scripting-readme.org][Scripting README]] to install and learn powerful scripting tools
        
*** Computational Art
    
See the [[file:2022-01-24-meeting-1.org][Notes from our first meeting]]!  Racket provides multiple toolkits for
doing computational art!

** Where we're headed in future sessions
      - Systems Programming
      - Custom Web Servers
      - SQL & Database Magic
      - The skills to realize any idea, elegantly!
